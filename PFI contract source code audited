Protocol Finance plans to build several Defi - Apps and then make these products into full-fledged projects thereby increasing the value of the Protocol Finance ecosystem.

For this audit, we analyzed the team's token smart contract, deployed at 0x7b69d465c0f9fb22affae56aa86149973e9b0966. We are not aware of any other contracts from the team.

Features of the token contract:
The total supply of 20,000 tokens is sent to the deployer upon deployment.
No minting or burning functions are present.
Tokens can, however, be sent to address(0) where they are inaccessible. Currenlty 1,001 have been sent to the address.

No Ownership-restricted functions exist.
The contract utilizes SafeMath to prevent overflow attacks.
